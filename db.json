"blurb": "Warm up as the cold nights set in with this glorious hotpot, with slow-cooked pork cooked in cider and sage. It\"s topped with a crispy layer of potatoes",
"ingredients": ["4 tbsp olive oil", "1kg diced pork shoulder", "20g butter", "4 leeks", "4 garlic cloves", "3 tbsp plain flour", "500ml dry cider", "400ml chicken stock",  "2 bay leaves", "½ small bunch parsley", "small bunch sage", "200ml single cream", "400g Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes", "400g sweet potatoes" ],
"method": ["Heat half of the oil in a deep ovenproof frying pan, or flameproof casserole dish, and fry the pork pieces over a medium high heat in batches until seared all over, then transfer to a plate. Add another 1 tbsp oil to the pan, if you need to, while you’re cooking the batches. Once all the pork is seared, transfer to a plate and set aside.", "Add another 1 tbsp oil to the pan with a little butter and fry half the leeks with a pinch of salt for 10 mins until tender. Add the garlic, fry for a minute, then stir in the flour.", "Pour in the cider, a little at a time, stirring to pick up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan and to combine everything. Add the stock, bay leaves and seared pork, then simmer, half-covered with a lid for 1-1½ hrs until the meat is just tender (it will later cook to the point of falling apart in the oven). Can be prepared a day ahead.", "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Simmer uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the sauce, if you need to – it shouldn’t be too liquid or the potatoes will sink into the sauce. Stir in the parsley, chopped sage, remaining leeks, and the cream, then season well.", "Peel both types of potatoes and cut into slices 2mm thick, by hand or using a mandoline. Alternate layers of potato and sweet potato in circles over the pie, or randomly, if you prefer. Dot the cubed butter over the top and bake for 1-1½ hrs until the potato is tender. Nestle in the whole sage leaves, brushed in a little oil, for the last 10 mins. Leave to rest for 10 mins before serving."]

"blurb": "Bake these caramel pear blondies for an indulgent teatime treat. With a biscuity flavour that comes from browning the butter, they\"re moreish and chewy",
"ingredients": ["250g unsalted butter", "3 large eggs", "275g light brown soft sugar", "25g dark brown muscovado sugar", "1 tsp vanilla bean paste", "1 tsp fine sea salt", "200g plain flour", "1 tsp baking powder",  "100g dried pears", "100g dark chocolate", "3 tbsp caramel" ],
"method": ["Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line a 20 x 20cm square cake tin.", "Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, swirling it around. Allow to bubble for a few minutes, or until it turns a light golden brown and smells biscuity. Remove from the heat and leave to cool a little.", "Tip the eggs into a large mixing bowl and whisk together with the light and dark sugars until just combined. Whisk through the melted butter, vanilla and salt.", "Gently fold through the flour, baking powder, dried pears and most of the chocolate chunks, being careful not to overmix (this will make the blondies dense).", "Pour the mixture into the lined tin. Top with the remaining chocolate and dollops of the caramel. Put in the centre of the oven to bake for 40 mins, or until a skewer inserted comes out with sticky crumbs (it shouldn’t be wet). Leave to cool completely in the tin. It will sink a little – the centre should be slightly squidgy. Cut into 12 squares. Will keep in an airtight container for up to three days."]

"blurb": "Sponge pudding gets taken up a level with the addition of delicious baked figs and thyme, resulting in a seriously comforting wintry dessert. Serve warm with cream, ice cream or Greek yogurt",
"ingredients": ["250g butter", "5 tbsp golden syrup", "4 tbsp honey", "8 fresh figs", "4 large eggs", "250g golden caster sugar", "250g self-raising flour", "1 tsp baking powder",  "1 tsp vanilla extract" ],
"method": ["Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 20 x 22cm ovenproof dish, then pour in the golden syrup and honey. Trim the stalks from the figs, then cut a deep cross in the top, just so they open out a bit, but be careful not to cut all the way through. Sit the figs upright on top of the syrup and put them in the oven to bake for 15-20 mins until softened and starting to caramelise a little at the edges.", "While the figs are cooking, make the sponge mixture. Put the eggs, sugar, flour, baking powder, vanilla and butter in a bowl and use an electric whisk to beat until smooth. ", "Remove the dish from the oven, scoop the figs out with a slotted spoon and set aside. Once the syrup mixture has cooled in the dish, take spoonfuls of the sponge batter and gently place them on top of the syrup. It’s best to do this all the way around the edge first, then end in the middle – this helps keep the syrup mixture separate. Smooth the batter out very gently to cover any gaps and seal the syrup mixture in.", "Bake for 35-40 mins or until the sponge springs back when pressed. Allow to cool for around 5 mins or until just warm, then seconds before serving, dot the surface with eight small dollops of the yogurt. Top each mound with a baked fig, then scatter over some thyme leaves and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, if you like."]
